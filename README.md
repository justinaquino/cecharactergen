The **Cepheus Engine Character Generator (CECG)** is a modular, data‑driven character generator for Cepheus Engine. We separate **data** (races, backgrounds, careers, equipment) from the **Rules Engine** (enlistment, survival, promotions, term loop, mustering out). Races, backgrounds, and careers are shipped as **swappable modules** so third parties can add, remove, or override content without touching code.

---

## **Definition of Done**

### **The Ultimate Success Criteria**

> **A Game Master or Player can generate 20 characters in 10 minutes and immediately use them in a game session.**

### **What "Ready to Run" Means**

Each generated character must be **immediately playable** without additional preparation:

#### **✅ Speed Requirement**
- **Batch Generate:** 20 characters in ≤10 minutes
- **Single Character:** <30 seconds from click to completion
- **Performance:** No lag, no loading screens, instant results

#### **✅ Character Depth - "Just Run With This"**
Each character includes:

**1. Complete Identity**
- Full name (culturally appropriate)
- Physical description (height, weight, build, appearance)
- Gender, age, species
- Believable background story implied by career choices

**2. Complete Statistics**
- All 6 characteristics with modifiers
- Full skill list with levels
- Career history (terms, ranks, promotions)
- Aging effects, scars, injuries

**3. **🎒 Detailed Equipment (Procedurally Generated & Believable)** ⭐**

This is **critical** - characters must have **ready-to-use equipment**:

**Personal Equipment (Always Included):**
- **Clothing:** Appropriate to career and tech level (vacc suit for spacers, tactical gear for military, worn clothes for drifters)
- **Personal Weapons:** If career-appropriate (pistol for scouts, rifle for marines, knife for rogues)
- **Tools:** Career-specific (engineering kit for technicians, medical kit for physicians, navigation tools for scouts)
- **Survival Gear:** Appropriate to homeworld/career
- **Communications:** Basic comm unit (TL-appropriate)
- **Personal Items:** 2-3 procedurally generated personal items (locket, journal, lucky charm, family photo, etc.)

**Mustering Benefits (If Applicable):**
- Cash on hand (realistic amount for career/terms)
- Ship shares (if rolled)
- **Significant Equipment:** ATV for colonists, vacc suit for belters, armor for marines, medical equipment for physicians
- **Weapons:** Quality appropriate to career (military weapons for combat careers, civilian models for others)
- **Special Items:** Tools of the trade, trade goods, contact networks

**Equipment Believability Rules:**
- Equipment must make sense for the **career** (Marines don't get trade goods, Merchants don't get battle dress)
- Equipment must match **tech level** (TL9 character shouldn't have TL12 gear)
- Equipment must be **usable** - not just a list, but items with game stats
- Equipment must be **consistent** - if they have Vacc Suit skill, they should have a vacc suit

**Example - Believable Equipment Set:**
```
Drifter (3 terms, just mustered out):
- Worn civilian clothing (TL9, patched)
- Emergency vacc suit (1-hour life support, found/stolen)
- Survival knife
- Bedroll and pack
- Cr250 in mixed currency (mostly spent)
- Locket with photo (personal item)
- Cheap pistol (unreliable, 3 magazines)
- Portable comm unit (damaged, intermittent)
- Street contacts (not equipment, but resource)
```

**Example - Wrong Equipment (NOT Acceptable):**
```
Drifter (3 terms):
- Battle Dress (TL12) ❌ (Too high tech, wrong career)
- 1,000,000 Cr ❌ (Drifters don't save money)
- Starship ❌ (Not a mustering benefit for drifters)
- No vacc suit despite Belter background ❌ (Inconsistent)
```

**4. Social Connections**
- Contacts (NPCs they know)
- Allies (friends who will help)
- Enemies (rivals, problems)
- Patrons (if applicable)

**5. Complete History**
- Every dice roll shown (transparency)
- Career progression (why they have those skills)
- Events that shaped them
- Reason for adventuring (mustering out motivation)

#### **✅ GM Utility**
The GM can:
- **Print character sheets** and hand them to players
- **Use as NPCs** with zero prep
- **See at a glance:** What this character can do, what they have, who they know
- **Improvise:** Equipment list suggests story hooks ("Why do they have a stolen marine helmet?")

#### **✅ Batch Usability**
When generating 20 characters:
- **Diverse:** Mix of careers, backgrounds, skill sets
- **Balanced:** Not all combat monsters or all useless
- **Interesting:** Some have debts, some have ship shares, some have enemies
- **Instant Plot Seeds:** Equipment and contacts suggest adventures

### **Testing the Definition of Done**

**The 10-Minute Test:**
1. Open the character generator
2. Set parameters (TL9, Human, 7 careers enabled)
3. Click "Generate 20 Characters"
4. Wait for completion
5. Review all 20 character sheets

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Completed in ≤10 minutes
- [ ] All 20 characters have believable equipment
- [ ] All 20 have usable skill sets
- [ ] GM could run a game with these 20 as NPCs immediately
- [ ] No character requires the GM to "fix" their equipment

**Example Scenario - "The Bar on Startown"**
The GM needs 20 patrons for a bar scene. Generates batch. Gets:
- 3 Drifters (looking for work, minimal gear)
- 2 Merchants (negotiating deals, nice clothes, comm units)
- 1 Marine (on leave, military gear, disciplined)
- 2 Scouts (explorers, vacc suits, survival gear)
- 1 Rogue (con artist, nice clothes, hidden pistol)
- 1 Belter (miner, vacc suit, zero-g tools)
- 1 Pirate (nervous, mismatched gear, stolen items)
- 1 Colonist (farmer, practical clothes, seeds/tools)
- 1 Mercenary (professional gear, weapons)
- 1 Barbarian (primitive gear, confused by high tech)
- 6 Other varied careers

**Result:** GM can immediately roleplay this bar. Each character's equipment suggests what they're doing there. No prep needed.

## **Development Model: Iterative with Feedback**

### **Stage → Review → Feedback → Iterate → Proceed**

This project uses an **iterative development model** where each stage includes a mandatory review and feedback period:

```
Stage N Development (2 weeks)
        ↓
Stage N Review & Internal Testing (3-5 days)
        ↓
Feedback Collection (GitHub Issues, user testing)
        ↓
┌───────────────────┐
│ Issues Found?     │
│ [Yes] → Iterate   │──→ Back to Stage N Development
│ [No]  → Proceed   │──→ Move to Stage N+1
└───────────────────┘
```

### **Key Principles**

1. **Stages Can Move Backward:** If testing reveals critical issues, we return to the previous stage rather than patching forward
2. **Feedback-Driven:** Justin and community testing determines when a stage is "done"
3. **No Stage is Immutable:** Previous stages can be reopened based on new requirements
4. **Buffer Time:** 1 week between stages for review and course correction

### **Review Checklist for Each Stage**

Before proceeding to the next stage, the following must be true:
- [ ] Feature complete according to stage definition
- [ ] Justin has tested on target devices
- [ ] No critical bugs in GitHub Issues
- [ ] Feedback from at least 2 test users (if available)
- [ ] Documentation updated in wiki

## **Core Components**

### **1) Character Object**

The canonical ("living") character sheet.

- **Name** (string with procedurally generated or user-specified name)
- **Age** (starts at 18)
- **Gender** (Male/Female/Other)
- **Physical Attributes** (height, weight, build — procedurally generated)
- **Appearance** (procedurally generated description)
- **Race/Species** (default: "Human")
- **Background** (string)
- **Terms** (int; 1 term = 4 years)
- **Careers** (array of `{ name, terms, rank, history }`) – tracks career history including service length and military/civil **Rank** (e.g., Lieutenant, Captain, General)
- **Status** (string) – denotes noble or social titles derived from high SOC (e.g., Knight, Duke, King, Taipan, Patriarch)
- **Abilities** `{ Str, Dex, End, Int, Edu, Soc }` (+ optional: Psi, Wis, etc.)
- **Skills** (array like `"Gunnery-1"`)
- **Assets** (array)
- **Conditions** (array; e.g., "Wounded")
- **Roll History** (array of all dice rolls for transparency)

### **2) Rules Engine**

Pure logic. Executes CCC setup, background/race effects, enlistment/survival/promotion, term loop, mustering out, and finalization. **No embedded content.** Pulls from modules at runtime.

### **3) Data Modules (JSON/JS)**

- **Races Module** (e.g., `races.json`): each race defined independently; can enable/disable per build.
- **Backgrounds Module** (e.g., `backgrounds.json`): list of backgrounds with prerequisites/effects.
- **Careers Module** (e.g., `careers.json`): enlistment, survival, promotion, skills, draft, muster tables.
- **Equipment Module** (e.g., `equipment.json`): item definitions with keywords for filtering.
- **Names Module** (e.g., `names.json`): culturally-appropriate name databases by ethnicity/culture.
- **Appearance Module** (e.g., `appearance.json`): procedural description templates with height/weight/build.
- **Mustering Module** (e.g., `mustering.json`): benefit tables, cash tables, retirement calculations.

---

## **Generation Modes**

- **Click‑to‑Generate (default):** One‑click build using current parameters; no step‑by‑step user prompts.
- **Batch Generation:** Generate N characters using the same parameters. Export as CSV or individual text files.

---

## **Career System**

### **First 7 Careers: Fringe & Criminal Focus**

These careers define the gritty, dangerous edge of the Traveller universe. They are implemented first to establish the core survival/mishap mechanics:

| Career | Category | Key Mechanic | Why First |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Drifter** | Fringe | Automatic qualification, lose job on survival failure (not ejected) | Simplest career, tests basic survival loop |
| **Barbarian** | Fringe | Primitive tech focus, STR-based survival | Tests low-TL careers |
| **Belter** | Fringe | Zero-G skills, independent operators | Tests space-based fringe careers |
| **Pirate** | Criminal | Illegal operations, high risk/high reward | Tests criminal career mechanics |
| **Rogue** | Criminal | Social skills, deception, underworld contacts | Tests social-focused criminal careers |
| **Mercenary** | Combat | Combat-heavy, military structure without official rank | Tests combat careers before Navy/Marines |
| **Colonist** | Civilian | Settlement, agriculture, frontier survival | Tests non-combat, non-criminal careers |

### **Settings: Career Cut-Off & Term Minimums**

The Opening Settings page includes career constraint controls:

### **Appearance Generator**

Incorporates physical stats into description:

```
Zara is a tall (175cm), wiry woman weighing 68kg with deep brown 
skin and short braided hair dyed with traditional red earth pigments. 
She has a scar across her left cheek and wears practical, weather-
beaten clothing that hangs loosely on her lean frame. Her hazel eyes 
carry the wary look of someone who's survived by their wits.
```

## **Mustering Out System**

### **Clear Rules for Mustering Benefits**

#### **When Can You Muster?**
1. **Voluntary:** After completing any term (age 22+)
2. **Forced:** After failing Survival roll (ejected from career)
3. **Retirement:** After 7+ terms (mandatory at 7, optional after)
4. **Career Change:** When switching to different career

#### **Benefit Roll Calculation**

```
Total Benefit Rolls = (Terms Served in Career) + (Rank Bonus)

Rank Bonus:
- Rank 1-2: +1 roll
- Rank 3-4: +2 rolls
- Rank 5-6: +3 rolls
```

#### **Cash vs. Benefits Choice**

For each roll, choose:
- **Cash Table:** Roll 1D6, get credits
- **Benefits Table:** Roll 1D6, get skill, item, or other benefit

**Cash Table Example (Colonist):**
| Roll | Cash |
|------|------|
| 1 | Cr1,000 |
| 2 | Cr5,000 |
| 3 | Cr10,000 |
| 4 | Cr20,000 |
| 5 | Cr50,000 |
| 6 | Cr100,000 |

#### **Retirement Pay Eligibility**

```
Eligible for Retirement Pay IF:
- 5+ total terms served
- Career provides retirement (not Drifter/Belter/Barbarian)
- Must roll on Cash table at least once in that career

Retirement Pay = Cr1,000 × (Terms in Career) per year
```

#### **Special Cases**

| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Failed Survival** | No benefit roll for that term |
| **Drifter/Belter/Barbarian** | No retirement pay ever |
| **Medical Debt** | Deduct from final cash (can go negative) |
| **Anagathics Debt** | Deduct Cr100,000 per use from final cash |
| **Criminal Careers** | May have "Heat" (legal problems) instead of benefits |

#### **Mustering Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Verify benefit roll count matches (terms + rank)
- [ ] Test cash calculations match tables
- [ ] Test benefit items populate to equipment
- [ ] Verify retirement pay only for eligible careers
- [ ] Test medical debt deduction
- [ ] Test anagathics debt deduction
- [ ] Verify failed survival = no benefit roll
- [ ] Generate 100 characters, verify no mustering errors

## **Equipment & Item Database**

### **Systematized Items with Keywords**

All equipment stored in wiki-based JSON database with keyword tagging:

```json
{
  "item_id": "vacc_suit_std",
  "name": "Standard Vacc Suit",
  "category": "armor",
  "keywords": ["vacc_suit", "armor", "space", "environmental", "standard"],
  "tech_level": 8,
  "cost": 10000,
  "weight_kg": 10,
  "description": "Standard vacc suit provides 8 hours of life support in vacuum.",
  "vacc_suit_system": {
    "type": "standard",
    "life_support_hours": 8,
    "armor_rating": 2,
    "mobility": "normal",
    "rad_rating": 0,
    "special_features": []
  },
  "availability": ["marine", "navy", "merchant", "scout", "belter"],
  "requires_training": true,
  "skill_required": "Vacc Suit"
}
```

### **Vacc Suit System (Mneme Detailed)**

Vacc suits are critical for consistent sci-fi habitat mechanics:

```json
{
  "vacc_suit_types": {
    "emergency": {
      "life_support_hours": 1,
      "armor": 0,
      "mobility": "impaired",
      "cost": 500,
      "use_case": "Emergency only, survival situations"
    },
    "standard": {
      "life_support_hours": 8,
      "armor": 2,
      "mobility": "normal",
      "cost": 10000,
      "use_case": "Daily operations, merchant crews"
    },
    "combat": {
      "life_support_hours": 6,
      "armor": 5,
      "mobility": "slightly_impaired",
      "cost": 30000,
      "use_case": "Military operations, marine boarding actions"
    },
    "heavy": {
      "life_support_hours": 4,
      "armor": 8,
      "mobility": "impaired",
      "cost": 75000,
      "use_case": "EVA construction, hazardous environments"
    }
  },
  "lifepod_integration": {
    "standard_suit_fits": true,
    "combat_suit_fits": false,
    "emergency_suit_fits": true,
    "lifepod_capacity": "2 suits per pod (standard size)"
  }
}
```

### **Lifepod System (Mneme)**

For consistent habitat and emergency procedures:

```json
{
  "lifepod_types": {
    "personal": {
      "capacity": 1,
      "duration_hours": 168,
      "comfort": "cramped",
      "features": ["basic_life_support", "emergency_beacon", "vacc_suit_storage:1"],
      "typical_location": "Personal quarters, small craft"
    },
    "standard": {
      "capacity": 2,
      "duration_hours": 720,
      "comfort": "basic",
      "features": ["extended_life_support", "emergency_beacon", "vacc_suit_storage:2", "basic_supplies"],
      "typical_location": "Ship corridors, work areas"
    },
    "bulk": {
      "capacity": 10,
      "duration_hours": 240,
      "comfort": "crowded",
      "features": ["basic_life_support", "emergency_beacon", "vacc_suit_storage:6", "group_supplies"],
      "typical_location": "Cargo areas, passenger sections"
    }
  },
  "occupancy_rules": {
    "suit_requirement": "Vacuum exposure requires vacc suit before entering lifepod",
    "capacity_strict": true,
    "overcrowding_penalty": "Life support duration halved per person over capacity"
  }
}
```

### **Item Keywords for Filtering**

| Keyword | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `weapon` | All weapons (ranged, melee, heavy) |
| `ranged_weapon` | Guns, bows, energy weapons |
| `melee_weapon` | Swords, knives, clubs |
| `armor` | All protective gear |
| `vacc_suit` | Space suits, environmental protection |
| `tool` | Technical equipment, repair kits |
| `medical` | Medkits, drugs, surgical equipment |
| `vehicle` | Ground cars, ATVs, spacecraft |
| `communication` | Radios, communicators |
| `computer` | Portable computers, data devices |
| `survival` | Wilderness gear, emergency supplies |
| `luxury` | High-end non-essential items |

### **Career-Specific Equipment**

Careers automatically grant relevant equipment based on keywords:

```javascript
// Marine mustering benefit: Weapon + Armor
if (career === 'marine' && benefitType === 'weapon') {
  return itemDatabase.filter(item => 
    item.keywords.includes('weapon') && 
    item.tech_level <= character.tech_level
  );
}

// Scout mustering: Survival gear + Vacc Suit
if (career === 'scout' && benefitType === 'equipment') {
  return itemDatabase.filter(item =>
    item.keywords.includes('survival') ||
    item.keywords.includes('vacc_suit')
  );
}
```
